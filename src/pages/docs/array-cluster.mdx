description: Split a list into many lists of the given size

import { SourceLinkAndPreview } from '@/components/SourceLinkAndPreview'
import { TestingLinkAndPreview } from '@/components/TestingLinkAndPreview'

## Basic usage

Given an array of items and desired cluster count, returns an array containing `n` arrays (where n is the cluster count) with the items split as evenly as possible between each array.

```ts
import { cluster } from 'radash'

const fish = [{
  name: 'Marlin',
  weight: 105,
  source: 'ocean'
}, {
  name: 'Bass',
  weight: 8,
  source: 'lake'
}, {
  name: 'Trout',
  weight: 13,
  source: 'lake'
}, {
  name: 'Salmon',
  weight: 22,
  source: 'river'
}]

cluster(fish, 2) // => [[marlin, bass], [trout, salmon]]
```
