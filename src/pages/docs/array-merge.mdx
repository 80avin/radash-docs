title: merge
description: Combine two lists overriding items in the first
---

import { SourceLinkAndPreview } from '@/components/SourceLinkAndPreview'
import { TestingLinkAndPreview } from '@/components/TestingLinkAndPreview'

## Basic usage

Given two arrays of items and an identity function, returns first list with all items from the second list where there was a match.

```ts
import { merge } from 'radash'

const fish = [{
  name: 'Marlin',
  weight: 105,
}, {
  name: 'Trout',
  weight: 8,
}]

const newFish = [{
  name: 'Trout',
  weight: 13,
}]

merge(fish, newFish, f => f.name) // => [marlin, trout (weight: 13)]
```
